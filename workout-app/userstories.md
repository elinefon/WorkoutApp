# App description and user stories

This application functions as a workout diary. The purpose is for the users to be able to add their workout excercises in the app to easily find them again later. When running the app, the screen will look approximately like this:

To keep track of requirements and priorities when developing the app, we have user stories. These describe the key functionalities our app should have and why they are important.

## Workout log (us-1)

As a person interested in health and fitness, I need to keep track out my workouts so I can repeat the excercises later without having to remember every session.

The user wants a place to save completed workout excercises to make it easy to find them again later. The excercises should be added to a file by writing them in a text field and clicking an add button. All the added excercises should end up in the same file after they are added so that the user can see all the excercises in the same page.

### Important to be able to see

- When working out: a text field where the user can write down excercises and a button that writes to file when clicked
- After working out: a history of previous excercises

### Important to be able to do
  
- Add new excercises
