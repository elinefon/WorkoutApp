To keep track of requirements and priorities when developing the app, we have user stories. These describe the key functionalities our app should have and why they are important.

## Workout log (us-1)

As a health and fitness interested person, I want to keep track out my workouts so that I can repeat the excercises later without worrying about remembering past sessions.

The user wants a place to save completed workout excercises to make it easy to find them again later. The excercises should be added to a file by entering the details into a text field and clicking an "Add" button. All the added excercises should end up in the same file and displayed on screen after they are added so that the user can easily view their workout history.

### Important to be able to see

- When working out: a text field to write excercises into and a button to add them
- After working out: history of previous excercises displayed on screen

### Important to be able to do
  
- Add new excercises
