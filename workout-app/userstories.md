# App description and user stories

## App description

This application functions as a workout diary. The purpose is for the users to be able to log and keep track of their workout sessions to easily find them again later.

To keep track of requirements and priorities when developing the app, we have user stories. These describe the key functionalities our app should have and why they are important.

## Workout log (us-1)

As a health and fitness interested person, I want to keep track of my workouts so that I can repeat the excercises later without worrying about remembering past sessions.

The user wants a place to save completed workout excercises to make it easy to find them again later. The excercises should be added to a file by entering the details into a text field and clicking an "Add" button. All the excercises should end up in the same file and displayed on screen after they are registered so that the user can easily view their workout history.

### Important to be able to see

- When working out: a text field to write excercises into and a button to register them
- After working out: history of previous excercises displayed on screen

### Important to be able to do
  
- Add new excercises
