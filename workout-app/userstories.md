# App description and user stories

## App description

This application functions as a workout diary. The purpose is for the users to be able to log and keep track of their workout sessions to easily find them again later.

To keep track of requirements and priorities when developing the app, we have user stories. These describe the key functionalities our app should have and why they are important.
