# Sustainability in our project

## App features

In our project we wanted to focus on simplicity and an intuitive user experience, avoiding overly complex features. We wanted to ensure that each component serves a clear purpose and to not have an overwhelming interface.

We have focused on making the code efficient and maintainable by using object-oriented programming to allow for reusable components. This reduces duplication and makes the app easier to expand on or modify in the future. This approach aligns with the SusAF principle of technical sustainability, which prioritizes durability and efficiency in software design. There is potentially code that could be more optimized, we expect to learn and improve as we work on future projects.

The REST-API promotes a clean separation between the client and server, where changes to the backend and frontend can be made independently. If we decide to extend the app to a mobile app, it can communicate with the same backend, which minimizes code duplication and maximizes reusability of the core. This enables us to scale the app easier and supports expansion while conserving energy in line with SusAF objectives, and aligns with technical sustainability.

On an individual level, the workout app can promote healthy habits for the user. Many people struggle with having structured workout plans, so having an app where you can log your workouts can give the user a sense of success and motivation, which aligns with individual sustainability.

## Possible features for environmental impact

A possible feature to promote sustainability could be to have an rewards system for walking or cycling. This could motivate the user to get to places in other ways than by car, which would lead to a healthy habit of the individual and could also have a positive environmental impact. It therefore enables both the environmental and individual aspects of SusAF.

The app could also feature motivation to have the user work out at home or running outside instead of going to the gym. Going to the gym uses resources that could be avoided, i.e. heavy air-conditioning, energy used for treadmills and of course the potential drive to the gym (if they're not using our rewards system). Adding at-home workout programs could help in this aspect, and could enable a positive effect on the environment.

Finally, the app could feature a dark mode. Dark colors require less energy to illuminate, so changing to dark mode could save energy. It can also be beneficial to the user, as dark mode can reduce eye strain, especially if they are in a place with low lighting.

## Necessity of the app

One could argue that there are already countless workout apps on the market, and that adding another one that consumes data, storage and energy is not necessary, as each new app requires resources. To justify creating a new workout app, it should therefore add value and be unique. For example, by adding the previously mentioned eco features, the app could overall have a less negative impact. Therefore, although adding more functionality might require more code, development effort, and resources, it could be beneficial if the users find the app beneficial and actively use it.
