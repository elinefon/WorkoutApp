# Sustainability in our project

## Code simplicity

In our project we wanted to focus on simplicity and an intuitive user experience, avoiding overly complex features. We wanted to ensure that each component serves a clear purpose and to not have an overwhelming interface.

We have also focused on making the code efficient and maintanable by code reuse and using object-oriented programming to allow for reusable components. This reduces duplication and makes the app easier to expand on or modify in the future. There is potentially code that could be more optimized, we expect to learn and improve as we work on future projects.
By minimizing unnecessary code, we conserve resources and contribute to long-term sustainability.

The REST-API promotes a clean separation between the client and server, where changes to the backend and frontend can be made independently. If we decide to extend the app to a mobile app, it can communicate with the same backend, which minimizes code duplication and maximizes reusability of the core. This allows us to scale the app easier and supports expansion with less environmental cost.

## Possible features for environmental impact

A possible feature to promote sustainability for the user could be to have an award system for walking or cycling. This could motivate the user to get to places in other ways than by car, which would lead to a healthy habit of the individual and also has a positive environmental impact.

The app could also feature motivation to have the user work out at home or running outside instead of going to the gym. Going to the gym uses resources that could be avoided, i.e. heavy air-conditioning, energy used for treadmills and of course the potential drive to the gym (if they're not using our award system). Adding at-home workout programs could help in this aspect.

Finally, the app could feature a dark mode. Dark colors require less energy to illuminate, so changing to dark mode could save energy. It can also be beneficial to the user, as dark mode can reduce eye strain, especially if they are in a place with low lighting.

## Necessity of the app

One could argue that there are already countless workout apps on the marked, and that adding another one that consumes data, storage and energy is not necessary, as each new app requires resources. To justify creating a new workout app, it should therefore add value and be unique. For example, by adding the previously mentioned eco features, the app could overall have a less negative impact. Therefore, although adding more functionality might require more code, development effort, and resources, it could be beneficial if the users find the app beneficial and actively use it.
